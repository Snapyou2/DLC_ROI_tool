# DLC ROI tool
A tool for drawing regions of interest (ROIs) on videos and analysing DeepLabCut videos.

__We currently do not support multi-animal but will in the future!__

## Installation
Install the requirements from the YAML file with:
```bash
$ conda env create -f ROI_ENV.yml
```
The main one is that it requires pandas to not be on version 1.x. We use `pandas=0.25.3` :).

## Launching the GUI

```bash
#Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/PolarBean/DLC_ROI_tool.git
#Change you current directory to the repo's
$ cd DLC_ROI_tool
#Run the GUI!
$ python ROI_tool.py
```


## The DLC-ROI Process

### Step 1. Choose a Video
When you initially launch the application, you will be asked to choose a video on which to draw your ROI.

### Step 2. Draw Your ROIs
Click and drag to draw your ROIs (you can select the shape, rectangle or oval, as well as the dimension in pixels) and save them sequentially with `Set and Name.`

### Step 3. Load DeepLabCut File
Choose a scored DeepLabCut file (this should work with either the CSV or .h5 file, but I usually use the .h5).
This doesn't necessarily need to be the same video that you drew the ROI on, drawing the ROI set the XY coordinates of each ROI, and it will apply these coordinates to any DLC file you choose. If your ROIs don't move from video to video, this can be efficient. 

### Step 4. BodyPart to ROI
This is a necessary step and generates a CSV with the ROI an animal was in for each frame of the scored DLC video. It uses a majority method to determine where the majority of the animal was in any given frame. This can take a long time, especially with long or high fps videos, so if the application is not responding, just let it think for a minute or 3 :).

### Step 5. Detect Entries and Time Spent
This will quickly generate you a CSV file with basic stats on your videos, such as time spent and the number of entries into each ROI and between ROIs. 

### Optional. Save ROIs for Future Analysis
The `Save ROIs to file` allows you to save your defined ROIs to a CSV file, which can be loaded later to allow for consistency and replication of your analysis.

## Example Files
For users who do not have DeepLabCut installed, example `.h5` and `.csv` ROI files are provided in the `h5data/` and `shapes/` directories respectively. These can be used to test the program's functionality.

## Batch Processing
This tool now supports processing multiple DeepLabCut files with corresponding ROI files in a batch.

1.  **Prepare your batch CSV file:** Create a CSV file with two columns. The first column should contain the full paths to your `shape.csv` files (the ROI definitions), and the second column should contain the full paths to your DeepLabCut `.h5` or `.csv` files. Do not forget the header row !
    Example `example_batchinput.csv`:
    ```csv
shape_file_path,h5_file_path
shapes/Circ_right_1.csv,h5data/M10_1_720x480_30fpsDLC_Resnet50_Hab_CorrMay19shuffle1_detector_190_snapshot_200.h5
    ```
2.  **Click "Process Batch":** In the GUI, click the "Process Batch" button.
3.  **Select the batch CSV file:** A file dialog will open. Select the batch CSV file you prepared in step 1.
4.  **View Results:** The tool will process each file pair listed in the batch CSV. An `output.csv` file will be generated in the current working directory (`/DLC_ROI_tool`). This file will contain the analysis results for each processed DeepLabCut file.

The `output.csv` file will have the following format:
-   First column: Name of the DeepLabCut file (`.h5` or `.csv`).
-   Subsequent columns: Time spent (in seconds) and number of entries for each defined ROI. Column names will follow the pattern `[ROI Name] time spent` and `[ROI Name] entries`.

Example `output.csv`:
```csv
h5_file,ROI1 time spent,ROI2 time spent,ROI1 entries,ROI2 entries
video1.h5,15.3,20.1,5,3
video2.csv,10.5,25.9,8,2
```
